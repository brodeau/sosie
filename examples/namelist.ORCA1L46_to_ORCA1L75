!! cmethod  : the 2D interpolation method to be used
!!
!!            * use 'akima' if your input domain is regular (non-distorted grid)
!!
!!            * use 'bilin' otherwise (bilinear 2D interpolation)
!!
!!            * use 'no_xy' to only perform vertical interpolation, i.e. interpolate a
!!              a 3D field given on ni*nj and nk_in levels to the same ni*nj 2D domain
!!              but on nk_out levels!
!!              => for example interpolates a 3D field from grid ORCAX.L46 to ORCAX.L75
!!
!! *** Into the netcdf file to be created : ***
!! cv_t_out : name of time record vector in the output file [char]
!!            => set to cv_t_out='' if no time dimension
!! cv_out   : name for treated variable in the output file                [char]
!! cu_out   : if not = '': then change the unit of treated variable units [char]
!! cln_out  : if not = '': then change the long name treated variable     [char]
!! cd_out   : directory to create output file to                          [char]
!!
!! *** Naming of the output file : ***
!! csource  : short string to describe the origin grid         [char]
!! ctarget  : short string to describe the target grid         [char]
!! cextra   : short extra indication about the file            [char]
