!!
!! cmethod  : the 2D interpolation method to be used
!!
!!            * use 'akima' if your source domain is regular (non-distorted grid)
!!
!!            * use 'bilin' otherwise (bilinear 2D interpolation)
!!
!!            * use 'no_xy' to only perform vertical interpolation, i.e. interpolate a
!!              a 3D field given on ni*nj and nk_src levels to the same ni*nj 2D domain
!!              but on nk_trg levels!
!!              => for example interpolates a 3D field from grid ORCAX.L46 to ORCAX.L75
!!
!! idrown : Two values in this structure: np_drown, nt_smooth ([integer],[integer]):
!!          * np_drown : whether we call DROWN land filling procedure (>0) or not (=0)
!!            which propagates/extrapolates sea values (defined where lsm==1) of field
!!            cv_src by "np_drown" grid points over land regions (defined where lsm==0)
!!          * nt_smooth : the number of time smoothing is applied on drowned regions
!!            (only performed on land regions)
!!          => this treatment has absolutely no impact over sea regions, only over land
!!          regions, it is intended to prevent land values to polute/contaminate sea
!!          regions during the interpolation process!
!!
!! l_save_drwn : save the input field that has been drowned (idrown must be > 0!)
!!
!! ismooth : if ismooth > 0 the field to be interpolated will be smoothed
!!           prior to interpolation. By applying ismooth times a type of
!!           closest neighboors boxcar smoothing algorithm
!!           (check "SMOOTH" of mod_drown.f90)
!!         => this is usefull to avoid sub-sampling when your target
!!            grid is much coarser than your source grid
!!            (i.e. when interpolating from high-res to low-res)
!!         => start with a multiple of 10, typically 20, and adjust depending
!!            on the result
!!
!! jt1     : first time record to be interpolated
!! jt2     : last  time record to be interpolated
!!           => set jt1 and jt2 to 0 if you want to skip this option
!!              and interpolate the nt time steps of the current field
!!
!! jplev : level to treat if your file is 3D (spatial), has no influence if
!!         your file is 2D in space !
!!       ------------------------------------------------------------------
!!        jplev > 0 = level to treat (ex : jplev = 1 will interpolate only
!!                    surface field corresponding to the 1st level )
!!       ------------------------------------------------------------------
!!        jplev = 0 : perform 3D interpolation (if source file is 3D) !!! |
!!       ------------------------------------------------------------------
!!        jplev = -1 : overrides good sense and forces sosie to understand that
!!                     your field to interpolate is 2D with a time record
!!                     (usually the case if the time record dimension in your
!!                      source file is not declared as UNLIMITED => bad! )
!!                     => so SOSIE doesn't mistake this time record with a depth!
!!       -------------------------------------------------------------------
!!
!! vmax    : upper bound not to exceed for treated variable [real]
!! vmin    : lower bound not to exceed for treated variable [real]
